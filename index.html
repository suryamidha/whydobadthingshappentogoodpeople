			<h3>What is this?</h6>
			<p>
				This is a pleasure project by <a href="https://suryamidha.com">Surya Midha</a> born out of a bout of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stranger_(Camus_novel)">teenage existentialism</a> that was quickly resolved with some <a href="https://youtu.be/BlC3yzpzATY">Wes Anderson</a>. I know <i>very little</i> about <a href="https://youtu.be/-Vl41OxuAZM">anything</a>, so I wanted to learn from people who know <i>a lot</i> about <a href="https://youtu.be/vTSmbMm7MDg">everything</a>. Academics all over the United States were emailed a <a href="https://youtu.be/WHrn_pHW2so">simple question</a>: why do bad things happen to good people? We limited the response to 500 words or less.
